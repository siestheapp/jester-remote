# Models Directory

This directory contains Pydantic data models used throughout the application.

## Purpose
- Define data structures and validation rules
- Ensure type safety and data consistency
- Provide serialization/deserialization capabilities

## Guidelines
1. Each model should be in a separate file
2. Use descriptive names (e.g., `size_guide.py`, `measurement.py`)
3. Include field descriptions and validation rules
4. Keep models focused and single-purpose
