# Daily Progress Log - 2025-04-15

## What was accomplished
- Analyzed database schema for inconsistencies
- Created documentation structure
- Identified key areas for improvement
- Set up project tracking system

## Challenges faced
- Database lacks proper constraints and indexes
- Inconsistent measurement unit handling
- Redundant data storage between tables
- Missing documentation and tracking system

## Decisions made
- Created structured documentation system
- Prioritized database improvements
- Established clear TODO list
- Set up daily progress tracking

## Next steps
1. Implement high-priority database improvements:
   - Add foreign key constraints
   - Create necessary indexes
   - Add data validation constraints
2. Standardize measurement unit handling
3. Clean up redundant data storage
4. Begin implementing size recommendation algorithm

## Questions/Concerns
- How to handle unit conversion efficiently?
- Should we consolidate apparel_items and size_guides tables?
- What's the best approach for brand-specific sizing rules?
- How to ensure data consistency during ingestion?

## Notes
- Need to review current data ingestion process
- Consider adding data validation layer
- Look into caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Plan needed for handling international size standards
