1. we cleaned up the codebase structure and this is how to activate the streamlit site starting from a blank A3 terminal:

active streamlit through terminal:

    seandavey@MacBook-Air A3 % cd a3-ingestion
    seandavey@MacBook-Air a3-ingestion % source .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) seandavey@MacBook-Air a3-ingestion % streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py

     You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

        Local URL: http://localhost:8501
        Network URL: http://192.168.1.22:8501

        For better performance, install the Watchdog module:

        $ xcode-select --install
        $ pip install watchdog
                    
        ✅ .env loaded? No
        ✅ API KEY FOUND? Yes

2. fixed database foreign key constraints and added proper indexes:

run database migration:

    (.venv) seandavey@MacBook-Air a3-ingestion % python scripts/run_migration.py up
    Running UP migration...
    Migration up completed successfully!

    # to rollback if needed:
    python scripts/run_migration.py down

3. Implemented VectorMapper utility for measurement term standardization:

   - Created a robust utility class for mapping measurement terms to standardized categories
   - Features include:
     - Exact matching with O(1) lookup using reverse mappings
     - Semantic matching with configurable similarity threshold
     - Batch processing (sync and async)
     - Text normalization and error handling
   - Comprehensive test suite with property-based testing
   - Demo script for showcasing functionality
   - Integration with size service for standardized measurement processing
