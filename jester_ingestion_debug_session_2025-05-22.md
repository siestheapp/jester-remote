# Jester Ingestion Debug Session Recap

**Date:** 2025-05-22
**Time:** ~01:45 AM

## Session Overview

This session focused on debugging and improving the ingestion workflow for the Jester Size Guide Analysis Assistant, specifically the process of extracting size guide data from images and storing it in the database.

---

## Key Steps & Changes Made

1. **Streamlit UI/UX Improvements**
   - Refactored the chat logic so user messages appear instantly and added a "Jester is typing..." indicator.

2. **Database Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Built an ingestion service (`app/services/ingestion_service.py`) to take standardized size guide data and insert it into the database using SQLAlchemy async sessions.
   - Updated the ingestion logic to:
     - Normalize the `sizes` field (handle both dict and list forms).
     - Always check both the top-level and `metadata` dict for key fields (brand, category, unit, etc.).
     - Add debug logging for extracted fields.
     - Fail fast with a clear error if `brand` is missing.

3. **Async Event Loop Handling**
   - Patched the Streamlit app to robustly handle async database operations, using `get_running_loop()` and `run_until_complete()` or `asyncio.run()` as appropriate.
   - Applied `nest_asyncio` to allow nested event loops in Streamlit.

---

## Errors Encountered

1. **Event Loop Errors**
   - "got Future <Future pending ...> attached to a different loop" — Fixed by patching event loop handling in the Streamlit app.

2. **Database Integrity Errors**
   - `(sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.IntegrityError): null value in column "name" of relation "brands" violates not-null constraint` — This error persists and indicates that the ingestion code is still attempting to insert a brand with a `None` value for the `name` field.
   - Debug logging was added to print the extracted brand name and incoming data, but the error remains, suggesting the AI-extracted data is not always providing the brand in the expected location or format.

---

## Current Status (as of 2025-05-22, ~01:45 AM)

- The event loop issues are resolved; async ingestion can run in Streamlit.
- The ingestion service is robust against missing brand data and logs debug info.
- **However, the workflow still fails if the AI-extracted data does not provide a valid brand name, resulting in a database integrity error.**
- Next step: Further improve the extraction/normalization logic or enforce stricter validation before attempting DB insertion.

---

## Next Steps

- Investigate why the brand name is not being extracted correctly from the AI output.
- Consider adding a UI step to let the user confirm or correct the brand before ingestion.
- Optionally, add more robust mapping/normalization for all required fields.
